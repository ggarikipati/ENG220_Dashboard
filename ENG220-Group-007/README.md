Air Quality Visualization Dashboard for Maine
Overview
This project, developed for a Peace Engineering course, provides an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze air quality data in Maine. The dashboard is built using Python and Streamlit, and it offers tools for exploring air quality trends through various statistical and graphical methods.

Features
1.	Data Upload & Preview:
o	Users can upload a CSV file containing air quality data.
o	The app displays a preview of the uploaded data and allows filtering by rows and columns.
2.	Statistical Analysis:
o	Calculate standard deviation and average for selected columns.
o	Flexible row and column selection for custom analysis.
3.	Graphical Visualizations:
o	Create line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, and pie charts.
o	Select X and Y axes dynamically for tailored insights.
4.	Data Insights:
o	Explore key metrics, including the number of days with various Air Quality Index (AQI) levels, pollutant-specific data, and AQI statistics (e.g., max, median).
5.	Comprehensive Data Context:
o	Includes both raw data (2020-2024) and yearly averages to visualize long-term trends.

Usage
•	Navigate to the Home tab to upload data and start exploring.
•	Use tools for filtering rows/columns, calculating statistics, and visualizing data.
•	Visit the About the Data tab for detailed information on dataset contents and descriptions.

Dataset
The dataset comprises air quality data collected from 2020 to 2024, with metrics such as:
•	Days categorized by AQI levels (Good, Moderate, Unhealthy, etc.).
•	Specific pollutant data (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10).
•	AQI summaries (Max, Median, 90th Percentile).
