# ENG220-Group12-Gun-Violence
Our project explores the profound impact of gun violence on communities, focusing on the social, economic, and psychological dimensions. By examining case studies and data-driven insights, we aim to highlight how gun violence disrupts families, undermines public safety, and strains community resources. Our research emphasizes the cyclical nature of trauma and its role in perpetuating systemic inequities, particularly in marginalized neighborhoods. Through this work, we seek to foster dialogue, inform policy recommendations, and inspire actionable solutions that promote healing, resilience, and long-term community empowerment.
