Gun Violence Patterns in New Mexico

The problem we are investigating is gun violence in the city of Albuquerque and the state of New Mexico as a whole. More specifically, we are attempting to identify patterns within our collected data sets to determine any trends, areas, or demographics that are at an increased risk. Through data collection and analysis, we are identifying problem areas that have the greatest need for intervention and resources to combat the prominent gun violence. The overall goal is to provide data that can be used to implement a plan to reduce gun violence incidents first, in the city of Albuquerque and then the state of New Mexico. â€‹From 2008 to 2021, gun-related deaths in New Mexico rose from 283 deaths (14.1 per 100,000 residents) to 562 deaths (27 per 100,000). This data is critical for developing solutions and prioritizing efforts to reduce gun violence. Understanding the demographics and circumstances behind gun-related deaths enables scientists, law enforcement, and policymakers to collaborate on evidence-based strategies. The ongoing analysis aims to refine data sets for greater accuracy and actionable insights.
