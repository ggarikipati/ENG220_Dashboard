This project integrates contributions from multiple groups to analyze and visualize diverse datasets related to air quality, environmental monitoring, and gun violence trends in New Mexico and surrounding states. Each page represents a unique dataset and individual analysis:

---

### **Gun Violence Data Visualization in NM**  
Contributor: **DT**

Contributor: **EC**  
Using NO₂ (Nitrogen Dioxide) data shared by Group 12, this dashboard focuses on key columns such as *Daily Max 1-Hour Reading*, *Daily AQI*, and *Observed Count*. While initial visualizations had limitations, a refined monthly average analysis of South Valley trends was separately developed for clearer insights.
