# ENG220-Group15

Our groups project was focused on health care access across different counties in New Mexico. We are comparing the data between the population of each county to different areas in health care such as clinical care (which is access to clinics and the quality of care received), life expectancy, % of the population that is uninsured, quality of life, length of life, health behaviors, social & economic factors, physical environment, and % unemployed. We combined and averaged all data from 2010 to 2023.
