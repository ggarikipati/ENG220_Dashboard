# ENG220-GROUP-9

In this project, the objective is to analyze data related to firearm arrests and compare them both annually and monthly, focusing on the state of New Mexico. The data used for this project was obtained directly from the Federal Bureau of Investigation. From analyzing the data, we can observe that from 2018 to 2023, arrests related to gun violence have increased dramatically. This trend could be attributed to policy failures or to more effective data collection and analysis methods over the years
