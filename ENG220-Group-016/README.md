This project analyzed suicide death data across New Mexico counties to identify areas at higher risk. The findings revealed significant disparities in suicide rates throughout the state. Catron County stood out with the highest suicide rate in the contiguous U.S. from 2010 to 2020, at 63.2 per 100,000 people. Other counties with notably high rates or numbers of suicides included San Juan, McKinley, and Bernalillo. Rural and frontier counties like Sierra, Lincoln, Grant, and Colfax also exhibited elevated rates, although their absolute numbers were relatively low due to smaller populations. The project highlighted that while rural areas often have higher rates, populous counties like Bernalillo, Do√±a Ana, Santa Fe, and San Juan accounted for the highest absolute numbers of suicides. This analysis aims to inform targeted suicide prevention efforts and resource allocation to the most vulnerable regions in New Mexico.
