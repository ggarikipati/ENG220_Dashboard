This project was designed to show the data throughout the United States, and specifically New Mexico, to indicate that there is a major
mental health problem in the country. This dashboard was created to show the data of those who experienced frequent mental distress throughout the years with graphs and charts. 
The user that examines the data can change the graphs to see specific states in mind, like New Mexico. For example, they can select a state from the drop-down menu and select a type of graph or chart such as a Line Graph, Scatter Plot, Bar Chart, and Pie Chart. These graphs and charts will show data for the years 2015, 2018 and 2024, with New Mexico having more years for a more precise data analysis.
