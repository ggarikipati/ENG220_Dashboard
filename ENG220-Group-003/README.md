This interactive data dashboard uses USGS data to display the level of the McClure Water Reservoir over the past 17 years. The user also has the option to view the moving average of this data, to better visualize the downward trend of the level.

```Application.py``` is responsible for all formatting and manipulation of the data,
<br>```extracted_data.csv``` is our cleaned dataset that is manipulated in ```Application.py```
