Final Project Overview: Finance

This repository contains two distinct types of CSV files, each offering valuable insights into clean energy resources, non-clean energy resources, and health-related grants awarded to Santa Fe. These grants focus on combating emerging diseases, addressing STI prevention, and supporting respiratory immunization efforts.

The impact of COVID-19 on government funding, private sector investments, and community-based financing was profound. Government funding priorities shifted significantly during the pandemic, favoring health-related projects and research while reducing support for alternative energy initiatives.

Clean Energy Source Analysis

The first dataset, titled EPI, focuses on clean energy resource data. It includes stock index data from companies specializing in clean energy solutions, with key variables being the average annual stock price and performance trends in New Mexico.

Analysis of this dataset revealed notable trends. Clean energy stocks experienced significant growth post-COVID, largely driven by government subsidies. However, during the pandemic, funding allocation shifted away from clean energy and toward health-related priorities. Conversely, non-clean energy sectors like electricity saw increased support during the pandemic due to heightened reliance on electronic devices during lockdowns. This trend reversed post-pandemic, as funding for non-clean energy diminished in favor of clean energy resources.

Health Grant Analysis

The second dataset, titled CDC, compiles information on various health grants awarded to Santa Fe. This data provides insights into the pandemic's impact on the health industry and related funding patterns.

A striking observation from this dataset is the consistent pattern of funding surges during the pandemic, followed by substantial declines afterward. COVID-19 significantly influenced health sector spending, underscoring the pandemic's role in driving increased investments in health-related initiatives.

Conclusion

The collected data highlights how uncontrollable events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, influence funding priorities for clean energy and health sectors. Clean energy funding rebounded strongly post-pandemic, benefiting from government aid, while non-clean energy saw reduced support after an initial increase during lockdowns.

Similarly, the health industry demonstrated a high dependency on government funding during the pandemic. COVID-19 reshaped health sector spending, revealing the critical role of emergencies in prioritizing resources for public health.

This project underscores the importance of government intervention in steering funding trends, whether in advancing clean energy solutions or addressing public health challenges.
